Secure Next.js Deployment on AWS using Terraform
This repository contains the application code and the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) necessary to deploy a high-performance, secure, and cost-effective Next.js static portfolio website onto Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The entire infrastructure stack is provisioned and managed using Terraform, ensuring consistency, auditability, and rapid, automated deployment.

Architecture & Technology Stack
The solution utilizes a modern, serverless-adjacent static hosting architecture built for security and scale:

Architecture Diagram: Secure Next.js Deployment on AWS using Terraform

Component	Role	Specific Implementation Detail
CDN & Security	Global Delivery	AWS CloudFront with Origin Access Control (OAC)
Content Host	Storage	AWS S3 (Private Bucket) with Next.js (Static Site Generation/SSG) contents
State Management	Reliability	Terraform Remote State via S3 and DynamoDB (for state locking)
IaC	Provisioning	Terraform
Key Architectural Decisions
The infrastructure is explicitly designed for enterprise-grade security and reliability, as defined in the .tf files:

Strict Security Posture: The S3 bucket is not publicly accessible. It uses an S3 Bucket Policy to grant read-only access (s3:GetObject) exclusively to the specific CloudFront Distribution via Origin Access Control (OAC).
Global Performance: CloudFront is used as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache assets at edge locations worldwide, minimizing latency.
Encrypted Traffic: All end-user traffic is automatically redirected to HTTPS via the CloudFront distribution's redirect-to-https policy.
Secure State Management: Terraform state is securely stored and encrypted in an S3 backend and uses a DynamoDB table for state locking to prevent concurrent modifications.
Region: Resources are deployed in the eu-west-2 region.
Deployment and Usage
Prerequisites
AWS Account and configured AWS CLI credentials.
Terraform installed locally.
Node.js and npm installed for building the Next.js application.
1. Build the Next.js Application
Generate the static HTML and assets into the local out directory:

# Clone the application code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/terraform-portfolio-project.git
cd terraform-portfolio-project

# Install dependencies and build
npm install
npm run build

# Static files are now available in the 'out' directory
2. Provision Infrastructure with Terraform
The Terraform configuration automatically sets up the secure S3 bucket, OAC, and CloudFront distribution.

cd terraform-nextjs

# Initialize the backend (S3/DynamoDB) and required providers (AWS)
terraform init

# Review the execution plan
terraform plan

# Apply the configuration
terraform apply
The remote state is securely managed in the pk-nextjs-website-state S3 bucket in the eu-west-2 region.

3. Upload Static Content
After the infrastructure is provisioned, sync the built content to the S3 bucket. You can retrieve the exact bucket ID from the Terraform output:

# Get the bucket name from the output
S3_BUCKET=$(terraform output -raw bucket_id)

# Sync the local 'out' directory to the provisioned S3 bucket
aws s3 sync ../blog/out s3://"$S3_BUCKET"
4. Access the Live Website
The live website URL is the domain name of the CloudFront distribution.

# Retrieve the public-facing URL
terraform output cloudfront_url
The resulting URL is the access point for the fully deployed and secured Next.js portfolio website.
